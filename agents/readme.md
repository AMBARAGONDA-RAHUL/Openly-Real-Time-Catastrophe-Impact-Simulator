## ðŸŽ¯ Why Agent Onboarding Analytics?

Most Financial Risk Analysts focus strictly on reserving and capitalâ€”but at a high-growth, agent-first company like Openly, **agent onboarding is a critical lever for sustainable expansion**. Industry research shows that agencies with structured, data-driven onboarding retain more agents and grow faster [(VanillaSoft, 2023)](https://vanillasoft.com/blog/insurance-agent-onboarding-process). Without it, companies face high attrition, unpredictable policy growth, and missed forecasts.

This module **tracks every agentâ€™s journey**â€”from signup to first quote to first policyâ€”identifying bottlenecks, retention risks, and growth opportunities. By visualizing onboarding funnels, conversion rates, and time-to-milestone benchmarks, Openly can **accelerate agent productivity, improve forecasting accuracy, and reduce operational risk**.

**This isnâ€™t just operationsâ€”itâ€™s a financial enabler.** Faster, more reliable onboarding means more policies, better forecasts, and stronger reserves. In a scaling insurtech, the best analysts deliver insights that help the whole company win.
