# Openly Agent Claims Intelligence & Risk Dashboard

## **Why This Exists**

Openly is scaling rapidly into new states, expanding partnerships, and handling a growing portfolio of home insurance policies.
But with expansion comes **three high-impact challenges**:

1. **Agent Claims Bottlenecks** – Delays in claims processing due to manual tracking and fragmented data sources.
2. **Risk Blind Spots** – Inconsistent visibility into claims trends, fraud indicators, and loss ratios across regions.
3. **Expansion Uncertainty** – Limited predictive insight into which regions, policy types, or agent networks will bring the best ROI and lowest claims exposure.

These challenges slow down growth, impact customer satisfaction, and increase operational risk — especially dangerous for a fast-scaling startup.

## **What This Project Does**

This project delivers a **prototype solution**:

**An interactive, AI-powered claims analytics dashboard** built with **Python, SQL, and Power BI** that:

* **Tracks Claims Performance in Real Time**

  * Pulls and cleans raw claims & policy data from multiple sources.
  * Measures key KPIs: average claim settlement time, loss ratios, claim-to-premium ratios, and fraud probability scores.

* **Identifies Hidden Risk Patterns**

  * Uses machine learning to flag anomaly claims and predict which claims are likely to escalate in cost or delay.

* **Guides Expansion Decisions**

  * Runs profitability simulations to suggest which states or agent networks have the highest potential growth with the lowest risk exposure.

---

## **Why This Matters to Openly**

* **Customer Trust** – Faster claims = happier policyholders.
* **Scalable Growth** – Predictive analytics helps Openly pick the right markets and avoid costly missteps.
* **Agent Productivity** – Data-backed insights improve efficiency, freeing agents to focus on high-value clients.
* **Competitive Edge** – No other insurtech is offering agents a unified, predictive claims + expansion intelligence tool.

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Python** – Data cleaning, ETL, and machine learning for risk scoring.
* **SQL** – Query and join claims, agent, and policy datasets.
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for executives and agents.
* **Pandas / scikit-learn** – For analytics and predictive modeling.

## **How to Use This Repo**

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openly-agent-claims-dashboard.git
   cd openly-agent-claims-dashboard
   ```
2. Open `data_cleaning.ipynb` to process raw claims & policy datasets.
3. Run `risk_prediction_model.ipynb` to generate fraud and escalation risk scores.
4. Open `Agent_Claims_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI to view the interactive insights.

---

## **Example Use Cases**

* **VP of Claims**: See which regions have the highest claim costs and resolve bottlenecks immediately.
* **Expansion Strategy Team**: Compare loss ratios and agent performance across states before entering new markets.
* **Fraud Prevention Unit**: Prioritize suspicious claims for investigation.

---

## **Next Steps / Extensions**

* **Integration with live Openly claims APIs** for real-time dashboards.
* **Automated monthly trend reports** sent to leadership via email or Slack.
* **Geo-mapping features** to visualize expansion opportunities visually on a US map.
