# Openly Agent Onboarding & Risk Insights Suite

## 📌 Project Overview

This open-source repository demonstrates a **data-driven, end-to-end analytics platform** designed to help Openly unlock its next phase of sustainable, agent-led growth. Beyond standard financial risk and reserving dashboards, this project delivers **agent onboarding funnel analysis**—a tool to measure, benchmark, and accelerate how quickly new independent agents become productive, supporting Openly’s mission to empower agents with modern technology and insight.

This suite directly supports Openly’s **Financial Risk Analyst** function, while also solving a critical, under-addressed challenge: ensuring every agent who joins can quickly and confidently serve customers, driving both retention and growth.

## 🚩 Unique Business Challenge Addressed

**Agent Onboarding & Productivity**  
Openly’s rapid expansion relies on the success of independent agents. Yet, even the most innovative insurtechs can miss critical friction points in the agent journey—delays in training, low early conversion rates, and silent bottlenecks that slow growth.  
This project **tracks agent onboarding speed, identifies process bottlenecks, benchmarks new vs. veteran agent performance, and flags agents at risk of slow ramp-up**. By surfacing and resolving these issues, Openly can accelerate agent time-to-value and boost regional expansion.

**Included standard risk and claims modules** (see below) ensure you also comply with core reserving, loss, and regulatory needs.

## 💡 Why This Matters to Openly

- **Empower every agent from day one:**  
  Smooth, rapid onboarding maximizes each agent’s contribution—directly lifting policy conversions and customer NPS.
- **Find & fix hidden bottlenecks:**  
  Visualize where agents get stuck in training, quoting, and policy binding—and intervene faster.
- **Benchmark for continuous improvement:**  
  Compare new cohorts to veterans, and track onboarding KPIs by region, office, or partner.
- **Align with Openly’s values:**  
  Demonstrate transparency, urgency, and empathy by giving agents and leadership the insights they need to excel.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – Interactive, visual analytics dashboards for agent, risk, and reserving KPIs
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)** – Data cleaning, modeling, and predictive analytics
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Reproducible workflows
- **Mock/Public Data** – Simulated agent onboarding, claims, loss triangles

## 📊 Core Features

### 1. Agent Onboarding Analytics
- **Onboarding Funnel:** Track time from agent sign-up to first quote, first bound policy, and early conversion rates.
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Heatmaps and journey maps show where agents slow down in training, quoting, or binding.
- **Cohort Benchmarking:** Compare new agents’ performance (claims, delays, NPS) to veterans—by region, office, and product.
- **Predictive Insights:** Flag agents at risk of slow or unsuccessful onboarding for proactive support.

### 2. Loss Reserving & Risk Benchmarking
- **Chain-Ladder Model:** Estimate IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) reserves using Python or Excel.
- **Risk Heatmaps:** Visualize loss ratios, claim trends, and emerging risks by region, product, and agent.
- **Regulatory Readiness:** Support BCAR, S&P ERM, and stress testing with transparent, auditable analytics.

### 3. Claims Delay Prediction
- **Random Forest/XGBoost Model:** Predict which claims are likely to be delayed—by claim type, region, agent, or policy.
- **Actionable Flags:** Integrate delay risk scores into dashboards for real-time intervention.

### 4. Capital Adequacy Stress Testing
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Model catastrophe scenarios, visualizing solvency and liquidity impacts.
- **Strategic Planning:** Enable “what-if” exploration for leadership and finance teams.
