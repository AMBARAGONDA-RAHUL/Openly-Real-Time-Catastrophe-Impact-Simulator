# 🏦 Openly Real-Time Catastrophe Impact Simulator

**Professional-grade, open-source analytics for insurance risk, solvency, and agent growth.**

***

## 🚀 **Core Mission**

> **Real-time catastrophe risk modeling comes first.**

Empowering Openly’s Finance and Risk teams to:
- **Simulate loss scenarios** with transparency and reproducibility.
- **Benchmark regional exposures** and detect emerging risks.
- **Stress-test capital** and monitor solvency KPIs.
- **Support regulatory compliance** and strategic financial planning.

**Business and agent analytics** are value-added:
- **Agent-level exposure** for smarter growth.
- **Claims delay prediction** to optimize cash flow.
- **Faster, data-driven operational decisions.**

***

## 📊 **Core Features**

### **Financial Risk & Catastrophe Modeling**
- **Catastrophe Simulation:** Gross/net claims payouts by region and severity—auditable, regulatory-ready.
- **Risk Benchmarking:** Dashboards for solvency ratios, risk heatmaps, and exposure trends.
- **Capital Adequacy:** Scenario analysis, Monte Carlo simulation for extreme events, BCAR/S&P ERM integration.
- **Stress Testing:** “What-if” projections for reinsurance, coverage changes, and catastrophe severity.

### **Business & Agent Analytics**
- **Agent Exposure Analysis:** Portfolio concentration, high-risk region identification, optimal agent allocation.
- **Claims Delay Prediction:** Forecast policies with delayed settlements to boost cash flow and service.
- **What-If Scenario Planning:** Adjust event severity, policy coverage, or reinsurance to assess financial impact.
