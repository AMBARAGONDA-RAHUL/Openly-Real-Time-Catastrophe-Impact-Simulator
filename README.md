## 📌 Project Overview

This open-source repository delivers a **professional-grade analytics platform** anchored in loss reserving, risk modeling, and capital planning—**the foundation of financial stability and compliance for any scaling insurer**. Built for Openly’s Financial (Risk) Analyst role, this framework provides transparent, reproducible reserving, solvency analysis, and stress testing for rapid, trustworthy decision-making.

**Beyond the fundamentals**, this project also demonstrates how integrated analytics can accelerate agent onboarding, reduce claims bottlenecks, and improve forecasting reliability—showing that modern financial analytics is both technically deep and business-driven.

## 🚩 Core Financial & Risk Analytics

**Loss Reserving & Regulatory Readiness**  
Accurate, auditable chain-ladder and IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) reserving models—precisely what Openly’s Finance and Actuarial teams need for regulatory compliance and financial planning.

**Risk Benchmarking & Heatmaps**  
Interactive dashboards for real-time solvency ratios, regional/product risk heatmaps, and emerging risk detection—ensuring Openly’s expansion is both ambitious and prudent.

**Capital Adequacy Stress Testing**  
Monte Carlo simulation of catastrophe scenarios, supporting BCAR, S&P ERM, and strategic capital planning—so leadership can act with confidence, even in uncertainty.

**These modules are the backbone of the framework and directly align with Openly’s Financial (Risk) Analyst responsibilities.**

## 💡 Why This Matters

- **Financial trust and compliance:**  
  Enterprise-grade reserving and stress testing build the foundation for sustainable growth, regulatory confidence, and ratings excellence.
- **Actionable risk insights:**  
  Clear, interactive dashboards put real-time risk and capital intelligence in the hands of leadership and analysts.
- **Open, extensible platform:**  
  Transparent code, well-documented data, and modular design invite collaboration, audit, and rapid adaptation as Openly grows.

## 🏆 Value-Added: Business Growth & Agent Analytics

**Agent Onboarding Funnel Analysis**  
Track and analyze each agent’s journey—from signup through training, first quote, and first policy—identifying bottlenecks, retention risks, and opportunities to accelerate growth.

**Claims Lifecycle & Delay Prediction**  
Predict and flag claims likely to be delayed, using machine learning and real-time dashboards to reduce customer friction and improve liquidity.

**By integrating these operational analytics, the framework helps Openly not just monitor risk, but also drive growth and customer satisfaction—key to scaling a modern, agent-first insurer.**
